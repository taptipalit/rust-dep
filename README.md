## Framework for static program analysis for Rust

### Generate callgraph 

Prerequisite: The Rust compiler toolchain is installed on the system. 

Tested with: RustC version: 1.75.0, LLVM version: 17.0.6

1. Run `./run.sh` 

This script will --

a) Download and compile the LLVM compiler used by the Rust
compiler toolchain. We need this to build the LLVM pass. 

b) Clone the `ripgrep` repository and build it while generating the LLVM IR.

c) Compile the `callgraph-pass` LLVM pass. 

d) Analyze the LLVM IR with our `callgraph-pass` LLVM pass. 

e) Generate the JSON file for the callgraph.

2. To clean up the installation, run `./cleanup.sh`

### Known Issues

1. Symbol-name mangling has issues. The LLVM IR generated by Rust has Unicode characters which are represented by `$LT$`, `$GT$`, and so on. The scripts manually turn them to '<', '>', etc. but it breaks `rustfilt` in the process. The best solution is to prevent the generation of these Unicode representations in the LLVM IR. TODO.
2. TODO: add more attributes to the JSON file.
